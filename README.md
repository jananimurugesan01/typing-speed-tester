The Typing Speed Tester GUI project aims to create a user-friendly application that
measures typing speed. This project implements a graphical user interface (GUI) to
enhance the user experience. Users will be prompted to type a randomly generated
string of words, and the application will measure and display their typing speed and
accuracy.

Project Requirements:
Programming Language
Python 3.x
GUI Framework
Tkinter (a standard GUI toolkit for Python)

Expected Outcome:
1. Develop a GUI application using Tkinter.
2. Implement features for generating random strings for typing practice.
3. Incorporate a timer to measure the time taken for typing.
4. Calculate and display typing speed in words per minute (WPM).
5. Measure typing accuracy by comparing the typed text with the generated text.
